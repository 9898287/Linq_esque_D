# Linq_esque_D

This project is (NOT) a (direct) port of a few linq samples demonstrated in https://gist.github.com/leonardo-m/6e9315a57fe9caa893472c2935e9d589. Please be informed that this repo is purely meant for personal use and it does not showcase D programming language's any features.

This project is created only for my personal practice and it's open because I don't want to pay for closing the sources.

Thoughts:
1. A few strongholds is better than hundred of weak fortresses.
2. As we grow, our minds should broaden too.
